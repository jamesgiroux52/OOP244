This week we learned about Classes and their structure and attributes such as private and public member functions.
As well as overloading member functions we worked with output formatting and dynamic memory as well.

I found that this week was a good refresher on classes, inheritance and output formatting. I'm finding that I am
struggling with implementing the classes and how they work together, especially when member variables are private
as opposed to public structs. It took me a while to wrap my head around how to implement the modules 
NameTag and TagList. In the end, I think it looks pretty good, but I still have a global variable in each module 
to keep track of a few things like the longest word and the TagList array. If you have some feedback for me it would
be very much appreciated.
