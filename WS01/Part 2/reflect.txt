 ============================================================================

Not really sure where to start.

In this lab, we mainly reviewed how to organize modules and read and write to text files or CSV files. 

I have not really done any programming over the last three years. I was at Seneca for all three semesters in 2019. I also don't remember our workshop 1 
being anywhere close to as difficult as this one was. I literally spent probably 30-35 hours on it.  I am glad that I got a very good refresher on c++ and 
that I decided to take this course again. 

I think that part of my issue was that I had forgotten how to manipulate file data within my program so I had to relearn all of those functions. With such a large 
first lab, I just got overwhelmed. I'm very glad that this one is finished. I just kept getting problems and wasn't fully aware of how to implement the objects.
