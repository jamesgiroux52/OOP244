It has been a lot of work getting back into the swing of things with coding and C++. But I am really enjoying it.

This week we were focusing on dynamic memory and how to allocate and free up that memory when we are done using it. We also learned about overloading functions. 
For me this was just a refresher on those topics, but it was much needed. Dynamic memory is actually really cool. It helps keep our programs size down because 
we are only allocating memory we need and nothing more. Overloading functions is also very useful because we can have many ways to, lets say, display data or 
even read data like we did in this workshop. I am looking forward to the upcoming topics and challenges this course will bring me and am very glad I had less 
issues with this weeks workshop than I did on WS01. I'm finding that the DIY portions of the week are a great learning tool because you have to just figure it out.

Very sneaky with the sorting... I thought I was done and of course when I tried to submit it I realized that we had to sort by Postal Code if the populations were 
the same as well. That will throw a few people for a loop im sure. I knew we had the bigger CSV file and was sure our code would have to read that at some point, 
but yeah lol.

Thank you, Dr. Khan for always getting back to me quickly with the questions I have. I'm glad you are my professor for 244.
